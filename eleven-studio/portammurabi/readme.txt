Hey there !
The game is ready.
Sadly I couldn't spend more than 12 hours on it.
Some parts are really 'hacky' and could use less lines.

That's not much but i hope you'll find it interesting.
Anyway I had a great time considering how much I hate playing with strings... =)
Thank you very much!
Bye !

!!! You'll need to download the folders 'art' and 'errors' and put them in the same folder as 'build.exe' to run the game. !!!
